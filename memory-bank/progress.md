# Project Progress

## Current Status
- **Baseline Established:** The core project structure exists.
- **Memory Bank Initialized:** Core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created based on the initial README and file structure analysis.

## What Works (Based on README claims)
- `/v1/models` endpoint (presumably lists models from rules).
- `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint handles requests.
- Configuration loading from `.env`, `providers.json`, `models_fallback_rules.json`.
- Basic fallback logic (tries next model on failure).
- Model rotation logic (selects next provider based on state).
- Chat logging (configurable).

## What Needs Building/Verification
- **Testing:** No explicit tests mentioned or found yet. Need to verify:
    - Correct fallback sequence execution.
    - Accurate model rotation state persistence and usage.
    - Handling of various provider errors.
    - Correct routing when a model isn't in `models_fallback_rules.json`.
    - `/v1/models` endpoint output accuracy.
    - Logging functionality.
- **Error Handling:** Robustness of error handling across different failure scenarios (network issues, invalid API keys, provider downtime).
- **Scalability/Performance:** How the gateway performs under load.
- **Security:** Review of API key handling and potential vulnerabilities.

## Known Issues/Limitations (Initial Assessment)
- Rotation state is stored locally in SQLite; might not scale for distributed deployments without changes.
- Potential complexity in managing large `models_fallback_rules.json` files.

## Project Evolution / Decisions Log
- **[Timestamp]** - Initial Memory Bank created by Cline based on README.md.
